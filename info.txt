Tool Name: MetadataFieldScript

MetadataFieldScript is a tool that takes a feature and updates its metadata so that the fields are displayed
in the correct order (the same order in which they appear in the feature's attribute table). The script uses arcpy
and xml.etree.ElementTree to function, and is divided into multiple sections that contribute to a specific
process within the tool. These sections, alongside all variables in the script, are described below. 

Note: Due to the nature of working with xml files (the native exported format for ArcPro metadata), and their
      tendency to be non-uniform, automating the entire metadata update process proved to be difficult. As such,
      errors may occur on an individual basis depending on the features that are used. It is recommended to check
      the metadata afterwards and make corrections to any minor errors that might've occured by using 'Edit Metadata'
      in ArcPro. 

Description of sections included in the script:

     These sections are commented out, and are formatted as follows: # === *SectionName* === 
     
     Elements that are obtained from the metadata xml file (such as 'udom', 'rdom', 'attrlabl', etc.) contain various types      
     of metadata information. Examples include labels, description sources, values, etc.

     1. OBTAINS THE WORKSPACE LOCATION (GDB) 
	
	     User selects a geodatabase, where the features that will be used are located, for the tool.

     2. OBTAINS THE FEATURE

	     User selects the feature. 

     3. OBTAINS THE FEATURE METADATA AS XML
	
	     Extracts the feature's metadata as an xml file.

     4. CREATES ORDERED LIST OF FIELDS FROM THE FEATURE

  	     Extracts the field names from the feature, these are used as references to ensure correct order 
	     in the metadata placement.   

     5. OPENS AND EXTRACTS DATA FROM XML FILE

	     Opens up the xml metadata file and extracts the sections that house the feature field information.  

     6. ORGANIZES ATTRIBUTE DATA INTO CORRECT ORDER

     	     Takes the extracted feature field information and re-organizes it so that the fields are ordered correctly,
	     in the same way in which they appear in the feature's attribute table.

     7. UPDATES, "ATTRLABL", LABEL IN XML FILE

	     Updates metadata field labels.

     8. UPDATES, "ATTRDEF", DEFINITION IN XML FILE

     9. UPDATES, "ATTRDEFS", DESCRIPTION SOURCE IN XML FILE

	     Updates metadata description sorces.

     10. FINDS AND STORES ALL UDOM ELEMENTS IN LIST

	     Finds all metadata 'udom' elements, stores them in a list for later use.

     11. FINDS AND STORES ALL EDOM ELEMENTS IN LIST

	     Finds all metadata 'edom' elements, stores them in a list for later use.

     12. FINDS AND STORES ALL EDOMV ELEMENTS IN LIST

	     Finds all metadata 'edomv' elements, stores them in a list for later use.

     13. FINDS AND STORES ALL EDOMVD ELEMENTS IN LIST

	     Finds all metadata 'edomvd' elements, stores them in a list for later use.

     14. FINDS AND STORES ALL EDOMVDS ELEMENTS IN LIST

	     Finds all metadata 'edomvds' elements, stores them in a list for later use.

     15. FINDS AND STORES ALL RDOM ELEMENTS IN LIST

	     Finds all metadata 'rdom' elements, stores them in a list for later use.

     16. FINDS AND STORES ALL RDOMMIN ELEMENTS IN LIST

	     Finds all metadata 'rdommin' elements, stores them in a list for later use.

     17. FINDS AND STORES ALL RDOMMAX ELEMENTS IN LIST

	     Finds all metadata 'rdommax' elements, stores them in a list for later use.

     18. FINDS AND STORES ALL ATTRUNIT ELEMENTS IN LIST

	     Finds all metadata 'attrunit' elements, stores them in a list for later use.

     19. FINDS AND STORES ALL ATTRMRES ELEMENTS IN LIST

	     Finds all metadata 'attrmres' elements, stores them in a list for later use.

     20. CHECKS IF "ATTRDOMV" EXISTS IN ELEMENT, UPDATES XML IF IT DOES

	     Checks each element 'group' in the feature metadata and tries to identify if a 'attrdomv' element exists.
	     This element is the parent for other subelements such as 'udom' and 'rdommax'. XML file is updated if it 
 	     does in fact exist.	     

     21. CREATES AND UPDATES "UDOM" IN "ATTRDOMV" IN XML FILE

	     Creates and updates a 'udom' element.

     22. CREATES AND UPDATES "EDOM" IN "ATTRDOMV" IN XML FILE

	     Creates and updates a 'edom' element.

     23. CREATES AND UPDATES "RDOM" IN "ATTRDOMV" IN XML FILE

	     Creates and updates an 'rdom' element.

     24. CREATES AND UPDATES "EDOMV" IN "EDOM" IN XML FILE

	     Creates and updates an 'edomv' element.

     25. CREATES AND UPDATES "EDOMVD" IN "EDOM" IN XML FILE

     28. CREATES AND UPDATES "RDOMMAX" IN "RDOM" IN XML FILE

	     Creates and updates an 'rdommax' element.

     29. CREATES AND UPDATES "ATTRUNIT" IN "RDOM" IN XML FILE

	     Creates and updates an 'attrunit' element.

     30. CREATES AND UPDATES "ATTRMRES" IN "RDOM" IN XML FILE

	     Creates and updates an 'attrmres' element.

     31. WRITES A NEW, UPDATED, XML FILE

	     Creates a new xml metadata file, based on the changes made to the original metadata file.

     32. UPDATES FEATURE WITH NEW XML FILE
